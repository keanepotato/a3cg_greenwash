## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure

The datasets used in this work are located in the `dataset` directory, which includes the following subfolders:

- `full/`  
  Contains the **full dataset**, with all data from folds 1, 2, and 3 combined.  
  - This version **does not** partition aspect categories into *seen* and *unseen*.  
  - This is primarily utilised within the paper to test for the general training stability of the dataset.

- `fold_1/`, `fold_2/`, `fold_3/`  
  Each fold directory contains four pre-partitioned JSON files based on aspect category visibility:

  - `fold_<x>_seen_train.json`: Training data with *seen* aspect categories  
  - `fold_<x>_seen_val.json`: Validation data with *seen* aspect categories  
  - `fold_<x>_seen_test.json`: Test data with *seen* aspect categories  
  - `fold_<x>_unseen_test.json`: Test data with *unseen* aspect categories (i.e., categories not encountered during training)
  
  *(Replace `<x>` with 1, 2, or 3 for each fold)*

  `statistics\` directory within each fold provides the details of the data within each fold and its corresponding partitions, including the aspect category count etc.

### ðŸ§ª Experimental Protocol

- We **train** on `fold_<x>_seen_train.json` and **validate** on `fold_<x>_seen_val.json`.
- We **evaluate** model performance on both `fold_<x>_seen_test.json` and `fold_<x>_unseen_test.json`.
- The *seen* partitions include only aspect categories observed during training, while *unseen* test sets evaluate generalization to novel aspect categories.
