## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure

The datasets used in this work are located in the `dataset` directory, which includes the following subfolders:

- `full/`  
  Contains the **full dataset**, with all data from folds 1, 2, and 3 combined.  
  - This version **does not** partition aspect categories into *seen* and *unseen*.  
  - This is primarily utilised within the paper to test for the general training stability of the dataset.

- `fold_1/`, `fold_2/`, `fold_3/`  
  Each fold directory contains four pre-partitioned JSON files based on aspect category visibility:

  - `fold_<x>_seen_train.json`: Training data with *seen* aspect categories  
  - `fold_<x>_seen_val.json`: Validation data with *seen* aspect categories  
  - `fold_<x>_seen_test.json`: Test data with *seen* aspect categories  
  - `fold_<x>_unseen_test.json`: Test data with *unseen* aspect categories (i.e., categories not encountered during training)
  
  *(Replace `<x>` with 1, 2, or 3 for each fold)*

  `statistics/` directory within each fold provides the details of the data within each fold and its corresponding partitions, including the aspect category count etc.

### ðŸ§ª Experimental Protocol

- We **train** on `fold_<x>_seen_train.json` and **validate** on `fold_<x>_seen_val.json`.
- We **evaluate** model performance on both `fold_<x>_seen_test.json` and `fold_<x>_unseen_test.json`.
- The *seen* partitions include only aspect categories observed during training, while *unseen* test sets evaluate generalization to novel aspect categories.

### ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation

ðŸš§ **Coming soon!** We're currently cleaning up our code base and will release model checkpoints and evaluation outputs shortly.

    abstract = "Sustainability reports are key for evaluating companies' environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. To analyze these reports, NLP approaches can efficiently extract ESG insights at scale. However, even the most advanced NLP methods lack robustness against ESG content that is greenwashed {--} i.e. sustainability claims that are misleading, exaggerated, and fabricated. Accordingly, existing NLP approaches often extract insights that reflect misleading or exaggerated sustainability claims rather than objective ESG performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce A3CG - \textbf{A}spect-\textbf{A}ction \textbf{A}nalysis with Cross-\textbf{C}ategory \textbf{G}eneralization, as a novel dataset to improve the robustness of ESG analysis amid the prevalence of greenwashing. By explicitly linking sustainability aspects with their associated actions, A3CG facilitates a more fine-grained and transparent evaluation of sustainability claims, ensuring that insights are grounded in verifiable actions rather than vague or misleading rhetoric. Additionally, A3CG emphasizes cross-category generalization. This ensures robust model performance in aspect-action analysis even when companies change their reports to selectively favor certain sustainability areas. Through experiments on A3CG, we analyze state-of-the-art supervised models and LLMs, uncovering their limitations and outlining key directions for future research."
